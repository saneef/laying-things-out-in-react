    <p>
      A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the
      time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.
      It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was
      able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I
      might be too late to assist at the d√©nouement of the little mystery. I
      found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
      form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of
      bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric
      acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so
      dear to him.
